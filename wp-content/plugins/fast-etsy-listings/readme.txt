== Usage ==

Utilize either easy-to-use Blocks in the Block Editor or visual editors for Classic Editor shortcodes, no need for you to type any shortcodes manually.

The key Blocks / Shortcodes you can add to your pages are:

= Etsy Shop Listings =

Presents listings from your Etsy Shop. You can also narrow down items to display by entering a search query.

The display of the results can be tailored into a grid with dimensions of your choosing and optionally as a slideshow.

If any parameters are left blank, defaults from the plugin setting will be used.

= Etsy Search =

Presents a list of Etsy listings, based on given search criteria. You can narrow down items to display by entering a search query, a category, country and min/max prices.

The display of the results can be tailored into a grid with dimensions of your choosing and optionally as a slideshow.

If any parameters are left blank, defaults from the plugin setting will be used.

= Etsy Single Listing =

Present details of a single Etsy listing. Simply enter the Etsy listing ID of the product to display.

= Shortcodes =

For reference, if you wish to manually enter shortcodes in the Classic Editor text view, you can find the syntax and [details of shortcode parameters supported here](https://www.fubaby.com/wordpress-plugins/fast-etsy-listings/fast-etsy-listings-shortcode-parameter-reference/). 

= Terms & Conditions =

By using this plugin you must abide by the Etsy code of conduct. Including, but not limited to:

* Promote Etsy items alongside unacceptable topics, e.g. sexually explicit material, violence, weapons, illegal goods, and discriminatory or hate-orientated content.

Fast Etsy Listings reserves the right to block usage for non-complying sites.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I just show items from my own Etsy Shop? =

The simplest method is to first enter your Etsy shop name in the setting field 'Default Etsy Shop name'. Then use the Fast Etsy Shop Listings block or shortcode which will then show stock you have listed on Etsy.

Alternatively, per block or shortcode you add to your site you can set the Etsy shop to show listings from. 

= Does Fast Etsy Listings display a link to the author's website under results? =

No! 
Fast Etsy Listings *does not* add any external links on your website back to the author's site. This clutters up your website, hurts your search engine ranking and is against WordPress plugin guidelines!
Only links to Etsy items you want on your website are presented and these are all tagged as 'nofollow' to avoid any negative SEO impact. You can optionally choose if Etsy links should open in a new tab/window.

= What types of slideshows are supported? =

Fast Etsy Listings supports several types of slideshow and pagination; manual, auto, 'load more' button, list by category.

Manual: Will present slides that visitors can manually step through using buttons beneath.

Auto: Will present a slideshow that automatically steps through the slides, fading between each every 10 seconds by default. You can change the slideshow speed in the plugin settings.

'Load more' button: Will present a button for visitors to load the next slide/page of results beneath the rest. 

List by Category: Will present a long list of results grouped under eBay category headings.

All slideshows can be configured with as many slides as desired, limited only by the number of items returned from Etsy.

Each slide can be configured with as many rows and columns as desired to produce a grid of items per slide.

Manual and Auto slideshow work best when displaying a grid with 1 or 2 rows of results. The 'Load more' button works best when displaying large numbers of results for a visitor to scroll through (especially mobile users).

= How do I customize the colors etc of listings? =

Within the settings, you choose to inherit your WordPress theme's color scheme (default), black text on white background, or white text on a black background style.

Alternatively, you can override the CSS styles manually. Please get in touch with the visual customization you would like in future releases.

= How do I customize the fields displayed on listings? =

Within the setting you can choose which fields to display for search results on blocks/shortcodes, results shown on widgets and for the single item block/shortcode separately.
